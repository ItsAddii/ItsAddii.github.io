Hey, I'm Addi!

I'm a passionate software developer specializing in building clean, scalable web applications and tools. I enjoy solving complex problems with elegant code and continuously learning new technologies.
I am enrolled in LaunchCode's Software Development bootcamp. On the side I am building personal projects, and experimenting with interactive design.

Currently, I’m focused on:

- Full-stack development with JavaScript, Java, and modern frameworks  
- Exploring best practices in software design, and testing.  

When I’m not coding, I’m working on creative projects that combine storytelling and technology, inspired by my love for games and music.

Feel free to check out my projects or connect with me!
